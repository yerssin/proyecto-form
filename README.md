# ![alt text](https://assets.breatheco.de/apis/img/images.php?blob&random&cat=icon&tags=breathecode,32)  HTML5 Form

Forms are boring, they are difficult to style, and we have to start dealing with the many user-related issues here (Like usability, security, validations, etc.).

On the other hand, forms are responsible for the Web 2.0, they enable interactive websites and all the fun!

In this project you will learn to style forms like a Pro! Using bootstrap components, HTML5 elements and your first small validations!

## Instructions

1. Please use your bootstrap/css and HTML5 skills to replicate [this exact same form](https://github.com/breatheco-de/html5-form/blob/master/preview.png?raw=true).

2. In order to practice all the classes that bootstrap gives you to style your forms, you need almost no CSS of your own.
3. You have to make sure all inputs are being used properly: Input type date, email, input type number, etc.
4. You also have to make sure to prevent and validate the form in all ways that HTML5 allows you (required inputs, formats, etc.).
5. Use the input type="date", don't try to code your own date picker calendar.
